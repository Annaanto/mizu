Mizu
====

Version 1.0 Beta

æ°´ (Mizu) is a Material and IBM Carbon-inspired theme and helper file for FileMaker developers. It is part of an overall design system at Proof that emphasizes the use of underlying structures (grids), design patterns and reusable components to enable more consistent and more collaborative work.

Mizu is designed for FileMaker 18 or higher. It works best with FileMaker 19 as an add-on component. To install Mizu for FileMaker 18, open the `proof_mizu_theme.fmp12` file locally in FileMaker Pro and import the theme into your FileMaker file using the Layouts>Change Theme menu command while in Layout mode.

For FileMaker 19+ users, you can double click on the `proof_mizu_theme.fmaddon` file. FileMaker will install the add-on and a new custom theme, Mizu by Proof will appear in your themes menu.

To uninstall Mizu in FileMaker 19, go to Layout Mode and uninstall the add-on from the add-ons panel.
