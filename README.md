## What is Mizu
æ°´ (Mizu) is a lightweight, Material and IBM Carbon-inspired **theme** and helper file primarily intended for FileMaker developers and affilate devs at Proof+Geist (Proof). 

:warning: If you are looking for a general-purpose theme to replace a built-in theme such as Minimalist or Apex Blue, this probably ain't it. 

Mizu works best when applied as part of an overall development and design philosophy at Proof. Some of its tenets are:

- Team > Individual
- Process over heroics
- Ship, iterate
- Avoid undifferentiated work
- Start small, loosely coupled
- UI (look) is good, UX (feel) matters more.
- Automate the boring stuff to pay attention to the important stuff.
- Pixel pushing is dumb

Mizu is made for FileMaker 19 or higher. It probably works in FileMaker 18 but your mileage may vary :). 

## Installing

For FileMaker 19+ users, you can double click on the `proof_mizu_theme.fmaddon` file. FileMaker will install the add-on and a new custom theme, Mizu by Proof+Geist will appear in your themes menu.

Mizu is released as an add-on component.

Download the latest release here, https://github.com/proofgeist/mizu/releases

To uninstall Mizu in FileMaker 19, go to Layout Mode and uninstall the add-on from the add-ons panel.
