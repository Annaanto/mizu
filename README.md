# Mizu

## What
æ°´ (Mizu) is a lightweight, Material and IBM Carbon-inspired theme and helper file primarily intended for FileMaker developers and affilate devs at Proof+Geist (Proof). 

:warning: If you are looking for a general-purpose theme to replace a built-in theme such as Minimalist or Apex Blue, this probably ain't it. 

Mizu is part of an overall design philosophy/system at Proof. Some of these tenets are:

- Crafting layouts at the pixel level is dumb
- Don't do undifferentiated work.
- UI (look) is table stakes, UX (feel) matters more
- Use underlying structures (grids), design patterns, and reusable components because #speed, #consistency, #collaboration.

Mizu is made for FileMaker 19 or higher. It probably works in FileMaker 18 but your mileage may vary :). 

For FileMaker 19+ users, you can double click on the `proof_mizu_theme.fmaddon` file. FileMaker will install the add-on and a new custom theme, Mizu by Proof+Geist will appear in your themes menu.

## Installing
Mizu is released as an add-on component.

Download the latest release here, https://github.com/proofgeist/mizu/releases

To uninstall Mizu in FileMaker 19, go to Layout Mode and uninstall the add-on from the add-ons panel.
